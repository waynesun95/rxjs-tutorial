    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        An <b>Observer </b> <i>subscribes</i> to an <b>Observable</b>.
        The <b>Observer</b> reacts whenever the <b>Observable </b> <i>emits</i>
        an item or a sequence of items. Furthermore, <b>Operators</b> are provided to
        take actions and/or manipulate the data that is emitted from the <b>Observable</b>
        before
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, imagine you are an oompa loompa working in Willie Wonka's
      chocolate factory. You are stationed at a conveyor belt where freshly made
      chocolates are being sent out from the chocolate making-machine. Your job is to
      collect the chocolates and deliver them to another part of the factory for more handling.
      However, before you deliver them you need to filter out the bad ones and wrap the good ones
      in the Willie Wonka brand chocolate wrapper.
      <br/>
      In this case, you could think of the chocolate making-machine as an <b>Observable</b>
      that is <i>emitting</i> chocolate bars. You are the <b>Observer</b> that is <i>subscribing</i>
      to the chocolate-making machine, waiting on a chocolate bar or a sequence of chocolate bars
      to come through before taking action. The process of filtering out the bad ones and wrapping up the
      good ones before delivering them can be thought of as the <b>Operators</b> being used to manipulate
      the data/chocolate (the actual act of filtering out and wrapping would be handled by operator(s)).
    </p>

    <p>
      From the <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html">RxJs</a> documentation:
      "... you define a mechanism for retrieving and transforming the data, in the form of an “Observable,”
      and then subscribe an observer to it, at which point the previously-defined mechanism fires into
      action with the observer standing sentry to capture and respond to its emissions whenever they are ready...
      An observer subscribes to an Observable. An Observable emits items or sends notifications to its observers
      by calling the observers’ methods."

    <h2>Observables and Observers</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, an observer subscribes to an Observable. An
      Observable emits items/sends notifications to its observers by calling
      the observers' methods (more than one observer can subscribe to a single observable).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The flow goes something like this (paraphrased from <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html">RxJs</a> documentation):
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
          Define a method that does something useful with the return value of an asynchronous call
          (Observables return asynchronous values). This method will be part of the observer
        </li>
        <li>
          Define the asynchronous call itself as an Observable
        </li>
        <li>
          Attach the observer to the Observerable by subscribing it
        </li>
        <li>
          Now whenever items are emitted by the Observable, the observable method will run
          with the emitted items passed to it
        </li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>
      // Example
      // onNext is our observer; it takes in some data and logs it to the console
      let onNext = (data) => console.log(data);
      // assuming we have some observable called myObservable, the following will
      // subscribe our onNext observer to the myObservable. onNext will be called
      // whenever myObservable emits a value. In this case, onNext will console log
      // the value whenever it is emitted
      myObservable.subscribe(onNext);
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      Observers can implement one of the following methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>onNext</b>
        <p>
          Observable calls this whenever it emits an item. Can be called zero or more times
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>onError</b>
        <p>
          Observable calls this if there was an error generating the expected data.
          This method as a parameter takes what caused the error. Can be called once;
          when it is called the Observable stream closes
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>onCompleted</b>
        <p>
          Observable calls this after it has called onNext for the final time (no more values to emit)
          Can be called once; when it is called the Observable stream is complete and closes.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When subscribing to an Observable, you can attach all three types of observers to handle all
      situations (when a value is emitted, when there is an error emitting a value, and when the Observable
      has emitted its last value):
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        // Example
        // next is our observer that implements the onNext functionality
        let next = (data) => console.log(data);
        // error is our observer that implements the onError functionality
        let error = (err) => console.log(err);
        // complete is our observer that implements the onComplete functionality
        let complete = () => console.log('Observable stream completed!');
        // attaching all three to our observable
        myObservable.subscribe(next, error, complete);
      </code></pre>

    <h2>Operators</h2>
    <p>
      Most operators operate on an Observable and return an Observable.
      They can be chained one after another; each operator in the chain
      modifies the Observable that resulted from the previous operator.
      Thus, <i>order matters</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We use the <code>pipe()</code> method to chain operators together
      before subscribing to the Observable that resulted from the chained
      observables:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      // example
      // subscribe to an observable and only return emitted values that equal 2,
      // and then multiple the value by 2 before returning it.
      // the subscribe takes the result of these chained operators
      // (in this case it is always going to be 4) and console logs it
      myObservable.pipe(
        filter(val => val === 2),
        map(val => val * 2)
      ).subscribe(val => console.log(val))
    </code></pre>

      The commonly used ones are highlighted in green.
